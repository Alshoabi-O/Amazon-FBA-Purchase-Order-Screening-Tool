# Amazon FBA Purchase Order Screening Tool

## Overview
A project I led at Amazon MENA to automate the inbound approval process for Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) orders, replacing manual reviews and enabling faster, more consistent growth.

## What
Designed and implemented a **Purchase Order Screening Tool** to automatically approve inbound items that met FBA growth objectives and business constraints.

## Why
Previously, account managers manually reviewed each inbound order, which:
- Consumed ~10% of their weekly time.
- Created inconsistencies in selection.
- Limited ability to meet future demand forecasts and price competitiveness targets.

Automation ensured:
- Consistent selection aligned with FBA growth goals.
- Increased efficiency.
- Improved marketplace competitiveness.

## When
2020–2021 (FBA Growth Target Period).

## Who
- **Lead & Designer:** Business Strategy Analyst (myself)  
- **Collaborators:** Head of Consumables, Amazon MENA Product Team  

## Where
Amazon MENA – FBA Program for 3rd Party Sellers.

## Using What
- **SQL** (DataGrip IDE)  
- **Excel Reporting**  
- **Demand Forecasting**  
- **Price Competitiveness Analysis**  
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**  

## How
1. Forecasted FBA product demand and performed gap analysis to prevent understock/overstock.
2. Analysed price competitiveness to prioritise low-priced offers and onboard new FBA sellers.
3. Applied constraints to approve only top three seller offers per item.
4. Automated the screening and approval workflow.

## Results
- **10%** reduction in account managers’ weekly workload.
- ~**30%** improvement in FBA performance across OOS rates, new product inbounds, offer depth, and price competitiveness.
- Eliminated inbound processing bottlenecks.
